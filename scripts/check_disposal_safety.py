"""CI gate: forbid unsafe Leptos signal writes anywhere in iem-ui sources.

Motivation (#153): Leptos 0.7 panics with "tried to access a reactive value
that has already been disposed" when `.set()` / `.update()` (or their
untracked variants) is called on a signal whose owning scope has been
disposed. The original trigger was a `spawn_local` task or a
`Closure::wrap(...)` that outlived the component that owned the signal.

The first version of this scanner only flagged writes syntactically
inside a `spawn_local` or `Closure::wrap` block. That was too narrow:
helper functions called *from* those blocks can write a plain `.set()`,
and the scanner missed them because the write site was in the helper's
body, not inside a danger-zone closure. A production panic on the
Android PWA (url="/" after navigating back) was caused by exactly this
pattern — a helper called from a navigate-back handler wrote a signal
whose owning scope had already been disposed.

The fix is to make the rule CONTEXT-FREE. Any call of the form

    <receiver>.set(...)
    <receiver>.update(...)
    <receiver>.set_untracked(...)
    <receiver>.update_untracked(...)

where `<receiver>` matches the Leptos writer convention `set_\\w+` is a
violation, anywhere in the file. Helper functions are covered for free
because the regex fires on the write site regardless of the enclosing
scope.

This is safe because:

1. Web_sys setters like `window.set_interval_with_callback(...)`,
   `opts.set_body(...)`, `socket.set_onclose(...)`, `element.set_onclick(...)`,
   and `headers.set(...)` do NOT match — their receivers are not named
   `set_*`, so the `\\bset_\\w+\\s*\\.` prefix of the regex fails.

2. The `try_` prefixed forms (`try_set`, `try_update`, `try_set_untracked`,
   `try_update_untracked`) do NOT match — the `\\b` word boundary before
   `(?:set|update)` requires the preceding character to NOT be a word
   character, and the underscore in `try_set` IS a word character, so
   the boundary fails inside `try_set`.

3. Rustfmt-split writes like

       set_alert_data
           .set(Some(x));

   are handled by a secondary pass: when the current line ends with
   `set_\\w+` and the next line starts with `.set(` / `.update(`, we
   flag the current line so fixers land on the writer name.

Allowed alternatives:

    let _ = set_x.try_set(value);
    let _ = set_x.try_update(|v| *v = value);
    let _ = set_x.try_update(|v| *v += 1);
    let _ = set_x.try_set_untracked(value);
    let _ = set_x.try_update_untracked(|v| *v = value);

Escape hatch: append `// disposal-safe: <reason>` to the flagged line and
the check will ignore it. Use this only when you can prove the write
cannot race with dispose (e.g. the write happens during initial mount
before any async work can suspend).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_disposal_safety.py

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any violation is found.

# Match identifiers that follow the Leptos writer convention (`set_*`)
# calling `.set(`, `.update(`, `.set_untracked(`, or `.update_untracked(`
# as a method.
#
# Why the word boundaries matter:
#   * The leading `\b` before `set_\w+` ensures we don't match inside
#     identifiers like `try_set_foo` — the character before `set` in
#     `try_set_foo` is `_`, which is a word character, so `\bset_` fails.
#   * The `\b` before `(?:set|update)` ensures we don't match
#     `.try_set(...)` / `.try_update(...)` — same reasoning: the
#     character before `set` in `try_set` is `_`.
#
# Why `\.` is escaped: we want a literal dot (method call), not "any
# character".
#
# Why web_sys methods are not matched:
#   `window.set_interval_with_callback(...)` → receiver is `window`, not
#   `set_*`, so `\bset_\w+\s*\.` fails on the receiver.

# Read-side danger-zone check.
#
# Leptos 0.7 `.get_untracked()` / `.with_untracked()` / `.read_untracked()`
# also panic on a disposed signal, with the exact same message as the
# write side ("tried to access a reactive value that has already been
# disposed"). Async tasks (`spawn_local`) and JS callbacks
# (`Closure::wrap`) can fire AFTER the component's scope has been
# disposed — e.g. a WebSocket onmessage handler delivering a frame that
# arrived during teardown — and any plain untracked read inside such a
# closure then panics.
#
# The tracked variants (`.get()`, `.with()`, `.read()`) are intentionally
# NOT targeted here: they are pervasive in reactive render code (view!
# macros, Memo bodies, on:click handlers) where the burn radius of a
# blanket rule is too big. The `_untracked` variants are exactly the
# ones used from async/closure contexts (tracked reads inside async
# would cause runaway reactivity), so they're a clean target.
#
# The safe alternatives are `try_get_untracked()`, `try_with_untracked()`,
# and `try_read_untracked()`, all of which return `Option<T>` and silently
# yield `None` on a disposed signal instead of panicking. The natural
# fix at a call site is:
#
#     let Some(v) = sig.try_get_untracked() else { return; };
#
# or, when a sensible default exists:
#
#     let v = sig.try_get_untracked().unwrap_or_default();
#
# The check is scoped to DANGER ZONES only — syntactic regions that can
# outlive the component's disposal:
#   * `spawn_local(async move { ... })`
#   * `Closure::wrap(Box::new(move |...| { ... }) ...)`
#   * `Effect::new(move |_| { ... })`
#
# Plain untracked reads outside a danger zone are considered safe: their
# execution context is scope-bound and runs synchronously during mount /
# render, so they cannot race with disposal.

# Match plain `.get_untracked(` / `.with_untracked(` / `.read_untracked(`.

# Second-pass detection: track locally-bound RwSignal names.
#
# Leptos `RwSignal::new(x)` is commonly bound to arbitrary identifiers
# that do NOT follow the `set_*` convention (e.g.
# `let local_value = RwSignal::new(0.0)`). The primary UNSAFE_WRITE regex
# misses these because its receiver anchor is `set_\w+`. To cover them,
# we do a first pass over each file to collect the set of identifiers
# bound to `RwSignal::new(...)`, then a second pass flags any
# `<name>.set(` / `<name>.update(` call on one of those tracked names.
#
# Two binding shapes are tracked:
#   1. `let <name> = RwSignal::new(...)` (and `let mut <name> = ...`)
#   2. Struct field initializers of the form `<field>: RwSignal::new(...)`
#      inside struct literals. This is conservative — the field name is
#      added to the tracked set even though the scanner cannot tell
#      which *receiver expression* owns that field. In practice, any
#      `foo.<field>.set(...)` call on a struct with such a field is a
#      disposal-race candidate and deserves `try_set` anyway.
#
# Tradeoff — known limitation of the field-tracking pass:
#
#   Field names are added to a file-wide set with no knowledge of which
#   struct they belong to. If the same file defines two struct literals
#   where one has a Leptos-signal field `foo: RwSignal::new(...)` and
#   the other has a non-signal field named `foo` (e.g. `foo: 42`), any
#   `bar.foo.set(...)` call in the file will be flagged regardless of
#   which `bar` is the receiver. iem-ui does not currently have such a
#   collision, but if one appears the correct fix is the
#   `// disposal-safe:` escape hatch on the specific line, not a wider
#   relaxation of the tracking. Keeping the false-positive bias over a
#   false-negative one is deliberate: a spurious try_set conversion is
#   harmless, a missed disposal race is a production panic.
